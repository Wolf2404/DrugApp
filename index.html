		<h3>Why stop</h3>
		<p>They are deadly.<br>
			You will not be in control of your actions.<br>
			You cannot know for sure what is in them.<br>
			People mistakenly think and will tell you they are safe.<br>
			You CAN overdose on them.<br>
			They are NOT like the real thing.<br>
			They are addictive.<br>
			You can still be arrested for using them.<br>
			Most hospitals don't know how to deal with a severe reaction or an overdose of synthetic drugs, as they won't know what is in the drug that is affecting you any more than you will.</p>

		<h3>Preventing a relapse</h3>
		<p>Once you've been addicted to a drug, you're at high risk of falling back into a pattern of addiction. If you do start using the drug, it's likely you'll lose control over its use again — even if you've had treatment and you haven't used the drug for some time.<br><br>
			Stick with your treatment plan. Monitor your cravings. It may seem like you've recovered and you don't need to keep taking steps to stay drug-free. But your chances of staying drug-free will be much higher if you continue seeing your therapist or counselor, going to support group meetings and taking prescribed medication.<br><br>
			Avoid high-risk situations. Don't go back to the neighborhood where you used to get your drugs. And stay away from your old drug crowd.
			Get help immediately if you use the drug again. If you start using the drug again, talk to your doctor, your mental health professional or someone else who can help you right away.</p>

		<h3>Pain and Consequences</h3>
		<p>It's a matter of time until an addict's life becomes unmanageable and is consumed with pain and unpleasant consequences.<br><br>

			If you are, or have been at this point in your addiction, the bright side is, this is often the tipping point where logic starts to kick in. But, the amount of pain required for anyone to want to change their life is different for each person.<br><br>
			This is often referred to as hitting "rock bottom." For some people, rock bottom can be losing their job, the threat of divorce, insurmountable financial difficulties, or unmanageable health problems. For others, the pain and shame has to be much worse (arrests, jail time, homelessness) for them to truly desire a better life. So, how much pain will it take for you to want to make positive changes?</p>

		<h3>Hope: A Necessary Component</h3>
		<p>If you feel your life has become has reached the depths of hopelessness, your lack of hope is keeping you handcuffed to addiction. Hope is essential in sparking the desire to make a change in your life…hope that you can change and hope that your life will be better if you are successful.<br><br>
			Hope can come from a respected teacher, colleague, a pastor, a doctor, self-help material, or even a song. And, when you begin to feel hopeful that you can turn your life around, continue to focus on anything and everything that will bolster these feelings of hope.</p>

		<h3>Understanding the Importance of Living</h3>
		<p>Knowing what's really important to you and why you care about it can help you stay motivated as you begin the process of change, which to be honest is never easy and often painful.<br><br>
			For many people, staying alive and healthy for their family is a very strong motivator. And, if family is your reason for wanting to live and make changes, you'll need to concentrate on this motivation to keep other temptations from controlling you.</p>

		<h3>Passion and Spirituality</h3>
		<p>Finding something positive and exciting other than your addiction to be passionate about is the key to staying motivated and retraining your brain. This is hard to do if you're in the grips of addiction, but give it some time, and as you start down the road to recovery you'll find other interests that energize you besides drugs and alcohol that will replace the negative behaviors.<br><br>
			Finally, having some form of spirituality (not necessarily religion) will give you a connection to something greater than yourself. This will guide you in defining your own values and morals and promote accountability, all of which will help you in the healing process. It could be anything that lights your fire, like mindfulness meditation, or yoga.</p>
